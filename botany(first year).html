<h1>Eukaryotic cell</h1>

	<tr>
		they comprise orgsnis having an organised nucleus.Eukaryotic incleus all animals and most of the plants (exception blue-green algea and bacteria). they show typical mitosis and meiosis.life cycle has a sexual phase. cells have a double envelope <b>system</b> of organisation,that is, in addition to the plasma membrane that surrounds the protoplast the cell organisation are also covered by mrmbers.

		<b>structure:</b> An eukaryotic (=eukaryotic, Gk <i>eu- we true, karyan-</i>nucleus) cell possesses an nucleus with a double membarnaus and porous envelope and a nucleoplasm containing nucleolus and chromatin reticulum. chromatin later gets organised in to 
		chromosomes.it is basically made uo of DNA which is covered over by histone proteins. the cell wall does possess acid.cytoplasm contains endoplasmic reticulum,mitochondria,plastids,golgi bodies, vacules,etc. it also shows streaming movement oe <b>cycosis.</b>
		Attached to emdoplasmic retigulum or unattached in the cytoplasm are found ribosom having a sedimentation coefficient of 80.hence they are called 80S.Ribosoms areoccur inside mitochondria and plastids .they are how ever called 70Sin nature.Flagella,if present,are11-stranded.
